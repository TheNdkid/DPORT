Title: DeFi Portfolio & Liquidity Management dApp
Objective: Create a decentralized application (dApp) that enables users to track, manage, and optimize their DeFi portfolio and liquidity positions across multiple blockchain networks. The dApp should provide real-time analytics, key performance metrics, and automated insights to maximize returns while managing risk.

Core Features & Functionalities:
🔹 Portfolio Overview Dashboard
* Displays total net worth (in USD and native tokens).
* Tracks supplied, borrowed, staked, and LP assets across protocols.
* Shows historical performance & yield generation over time.
📊 Key Metrics & Real-Time Tracking
* APY/APR tracking for staking, lending, and LP positions.
* Net yield analysis (accounting for rewards, fees, and impermanent loss).
* Health factor & liquidation risk monitoring for borrowed positions.
* LTV ratio tracking with suggested collateral adjustments.
🔄 Liquidity & Yield Optimization
* Suggests best available LP pools based on TVL, APY, risk level.
* Tracks impermanent loss & optimal rebalancing points.
* Auto-compounding strategies for maximizing farmed rewards.
🏦 Lending & Borrowing Management
* Aggregates collateralized loans & stablecoin borrowings.
* Tracks collateral efficiency & recommended adjustments.
* Highlights highest-yield borrow opportunities (including incentive APRs).
🚀 Automated DeFi Strategies
* Risk-adjusted yield farming allocations based on market conditions.
* Smart liquidation prevention tools (e.g., auto-rebalancing).
* On-chain automation for auto-staking & auto-harvesting rewards.
🔗 Multi-Chain & Protocol Integration
* Supports major chains: Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Solana, Sui.
* Integrates with leading DeFi protocols (e.g., Aave, Curve, Uniswap, Scallop, Navi).
* Real-time cross-chain tracking with unified portfolio analytics.
📉 Risk & Performance Analytics
* Breakdown of gains/losses from yield farming, staking, and trading.
* Risk-adjusted return analysis (Sharpe ratio, volatility metrics).
* Security alerts for high-risk positions, liquidation warnings, or rug pulls.

User Experience & Interface (UX/UI)
✅ Clean & intuitive dashboard with customizable widgets. ✅ Dark & light mode UI for optimal visibility. ✅ Mobile-friendly & integrates with WalletConnect & Ledger. ✅ Gas fee estimator & transaction optimizer for cost efficiency.

Technical Implementation
🛠 Smart Contract & Backend
* Uses Subgraphs & oracles (e.g., Chainlink, Pyth) for real-time data feeds.
* Indexing transactions via The Graph for seamless data retrieval.
* Implements non-custodial architecture with full on-chain transparency.
🛠 Frontend & Web App
* Built with React + Next.js for a smooth user experience.
* Uses Ethers.js/Web3.js for blockchain interactions.
* Supports multi-wallet login (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Rabby, Ledger).

Future Enhancements
🔹 AI-powered strategy suggestions based on historical performance. 🔹 SocialFi features: Users can share & compare DeFi strategies. 🔹 DAO governance integration: Community-driven protocol improvements. 🔹 Advanced LP rebalancing automation for maximizing yield.

Final Goal
To create an all-in-one, non-custodial DeFi portfolio tracker that provides:
* Actionable insights,
* Real-time tracking,
* Risk-adjusted yield strategies,
* Full transparency & decentralization
