you’re hitting a snag when querying the positions(uint256) function, likely due to an ABI or contract interaction issue. The error "could not decode result data" persists, so let’s dig into the specifics and resolve it.
Key Observations
Contract Addresses:
0x827922686190790b37229fd06084350E74485b72: This is the address where you’re querying the position, and it’s yielding NFT metadata (token ID 7753534). You’ve labeled it as a "Custom NFT Collection" with positions.

0x82792F8F57635DC7e4C78FeB5a7a2CFD102A1cC3: Labeled as "Aerodrome Positions" in your code.

0x03A520B32C04Bf3BE5F46762fce6Cd5031F498c2: Labeled as "Uniswap V3 Positions."
The address 0x827922686190790b37229fd06084350E74485b72 seems to be the Slipstream Position Manager for Aerodrome on Base, as it’s returning valid NFT data tied to a USDC/ETH position. However, we need to confirm it aligns with Aerodrome’s official deployment.

ABI:
You’re using:
javascript
"function positions(uint256) view returns (uint96 nonce, address operator, address token0, address token1, uint24 fee, int24 tickLower, int24 tickUpper, uint128 liquidity, uint256 feeGrowthInside0LastX128, uint256 feeGrowthInside1LastX128, uint128 tokensOwed0, uint128 tokensOwed1)"

This matches the standard Uniswap V3 NonfungiblePositionManager signature, which Aerodrome Slipstream likely inherits. It should work unless Aerodrome modified the function’s return values.

Error Context:
You’re getting NFT metadata (token ID and pool details) successfully, possibly from a separate call or event log.

The "could not decode result data" error occurs specifically when calling positions(7753534) on 0x827922686190790b37229fd06084350E74485b72.
Root Cause Hypothesis
The error suggests one of these issues:
ABI Mismatch: The positions function on 0x827922686190790b37229fd06084350E74485b72 might have a slightly different signature than the Uniswap V3 standard you’re using.

Contract Address Confusion: You might be querying the wrong contract for position data (e.g., using the NFT collection address instead of the Position Manager).

Data Availability: The tokenId 7753534 might not exist or be valid on the contract you’re querying, causing a revert or empty response that ethers.js can’t decode.
Let’s verify and fix this step-by-step.
Step 1: Confirm the Correct Contract Address
Aerodrome Slipstream’s Position Manager on Base should be a single contract managing all NFT positions, similar to Uniswap V3’s NonfungiblePositionManager. Based on your addresses:
0x827922686190790b37229fd06084350E74485b72 seems to be the one holding position data, as it’s linked to token ID 7753534.

0x82792F8F57635DC7e4C78FeB5a7a2CFD102A1cC3 is labeled "Aerodrome Positions" but might not be the Position Manager.
Action:
Check 0x827922686190790b37229fd06084350E74485b72 on BaseScan. Look at its contract name (e.g., NonfungiblePositionManager or similar) and verify it has a positions function.

Compare with Aerodrome’s official docs or GitHub (e.g., Aerodrome Finance GitHub) to ensure this is the Slipstream Position Manager. If not, 0x82792F8F57635DC7e4C78FeB5a7a2CFD102A1cC3 might be the correct one.
For now, let’s assume 0x827922686190790b37229fd06084350E74485b72 is correct since it’s yielding NFT data.
Step 2: Test the ABI and Call
Here’s a debug script to isolate the issue:
javascript
const { ethers } = require("ethers");
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider("https://mainnet.base.org");

const positionManagerAddress = "0x827922686190790b37229fd06084350E74485b72";
const positionABI = [
  "function positions(uint256 tokenId) view returns (uint96 nonce, address operator, address token0, address token1, uint24 fee, int24 tickLower, int24 tickUpper, uint128 liquidity, uint256 feeGrowthInside0LastX128, uint256 feeGrowthInside1LastX128, uint128 tokensOwed0, uint128 tokensOwed1)"
];

const positionContract = new ethers.Contract(positionManagerAddress, positionABI, provider);

async function debugPosition(tokenId) {
  try {
    // Raw call to inspect the response
    const rawData = await provider.call({
      to: positionManagerAddress,
      data: positionContract.interface.encodeFunctionData("positions", [tokenId])
    });
    console.log("Raw Data:", rawData);

    // Attempt to decode
    const decoded = positionContract.interface.decodeFunctionResult("positions", rawData);
    console.log("Decoded Position:", decoded);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  }
}

const tokenId = 7753534;
debugPosition(tokenId);

What to Look For:
Raw Data: If it’s 0x or very short, the contract might be reverting (e.g., token ID doesn’t exist).

Error Details: If decoding fails, the error might specify “invalid return data” or “type mismatch,” indicating an ABI issue.

Success: If it decodes, you’ll see an array with 12 values (nonce, operator, etc.).
Step 3: Fix Common Issues
Based on the debug output, here’s how to resolve:
If Raw Data is 0x or Empty:
The tokenId 7753534 might belong to a different contract (e.g., 0x82792F8F57635DC7e4C78FeB5a7a2CFD102A1cC3).

Verify ownership with ownerOf(tokenId) (add to ABI: "function ownerOf(uint256 tokenId) view returns (address)") and ensure it matches your wallet.

Test both addresses with the same tokenId.
If Raw Data is Long but Decoding Fails:
The ABI might be wrong. Aerodrome could have modified the positions return values. Check the contract’s source code on BaseScan (if verified) or use a minimal ABI to inspect:
javascript
const minimalABI = ["function positions(uint256 tokenId) view returns (tuple)"];

Then log the raw tuple and adjust the ABI accordingly.
If It Works:
You’ve got the position data! Map it to readable values:
javascript
const [nonce, operator, token0, token1, fee, tickLower, tickUpper, liquidity, feeGrowth0, feeGrowth1, tokensOwed0, tokensOwed1] = decoded;
console.log({
  token0,
  token1,
  priceRange: { tickLower, tickUpper },
  liquidity: ethers.utils.formatUnits(liquidity, 18),
  feesOwed: {
    token0: ethers.utils.formatUnits(tokensOwed0, 6), // Adjust decimals for USDC
    token1: ethers.utils.formatUnits(tokensOwed1, 18) // Adjust for ETH
  }
});
Step 4: Validate Token ID Source
You mentioned the token represents a USDC/ETH position with a price range (2257.5–3047.3). This likely came from NFT metadata or a separate call. Ensure 7753534 was minted by the Slipstream Position Manager you’re querying. If it’s from a legacy Uniswap V3 position (0x03A520B32C04Bf3BE5F46762fce6Cd5031F498c2), you’d need to query that contract instead.
