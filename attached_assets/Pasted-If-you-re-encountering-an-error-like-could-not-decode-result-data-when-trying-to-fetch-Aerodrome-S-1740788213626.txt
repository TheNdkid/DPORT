If you're encountering an error like "could not decode result data" when trying to fetch Aerodrome Slipstream (concentrated liquidity) positions from a wallet that holds an NFT, it suggests an issue with how you're interacting with the smart contract—likely the Slipstream Position Manager—or how you're interpreting the returned data. This is a common problem when dealing with complex return types in Ethereum smart contracts, especially for functions like positions(uint256) that return multiple values. Let’s troubleshoot and resolve this step-by-step.
Why This Error Happens
The "could not decode result data" error typically occurs because:
ABI Mismatch: The ABI (Application Binary Interface) you're using doesn’t match the contract’s actual function signature.

Incorrect Token ID: The tokenId you’re passing to positions(tokenId) might not correspond to a valid position owned by the wallet.

Data Parsing Issue: The function returns a tuple (e.g., multiple values like uint96, address, etc.), and your code isn’t properly decoding it.

Network or Contract Issue: You’re querying the wrong contract address or the Base network node is returning malformed data.
Since you confirmed the wallet holds an NFT, let’s assume it’s a Slipstream position NFT, and we’ll focus on fixing the contract call.
Step 1: Verify the Slipstream Position Manager Contract
Aerodrome’s Slipstream is based on Uniswap V3’s concentrated liquidity model, so it uses a NonfungiblePositionManager-like contract to manage NFT positions. On Base, the Slipstream Position Manager address isn’t explicitly listed in Aerodrome’s public docs as of my last update, but based on community sources and Base explorer data, it’s likely:
Slipstream Position Manager Address: Check 0x8279226865B008CdaCd9Ccd970d000B4b8C3fA58 (this is inferred from Velodrome V2 Slipstream forks and Base deployments; verify on basescan.org or Aerodrome’s GitHub).
If you’re using a different address, double-check it against the official Aerodrome deployment on Base.
Step 2: Use the Correct ABI for positions(tokenId)
The positions(uint256) function in Uniswap V3-style contracts returns a tuple with multiple values describing the position. For Aerodrome Slipstream, it’s likely identical or very similar. Here’s the expected signature:
solidity
function positions(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (
    uint96 nonce,
    address operator,
    address token0,
    address token1,
    uint24 fee,
    int24 tickLower,
    int24 tickUpper,
    uint128 liquidity,
    uint256 feeGrowthInside0LastX128,
    uint256 feeGrowthInside1LastX128,
    uint128 tokensOwed0,
    uint128 tokensOwed1
);

Translate this into an ABI fragment for ethers.js:
javascript
const positionABI = [
  "function positions(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (uint96 nonce, address operator, address token0, address token1, uint24 fee, int24 tickLower, int24 tickUpper, uint128 liquidity, uint256 feeGrowthInside0LastX128, uint256 feeGrowthInside1LastX128, uint128 tokensOwed0, uint128 tokensOwed1)"
];

If your ABI is incomplete (e.g., missing fields) or mismatched, ethers.js won’t decode the result properly, causing the error.
Step 3: Fetch the NFT Token ID
Since you know the wallet holds an NFT, you need to:
Confirm the wallet’s NFT balance.

Retrieve the specific tokenId owned by the wallet.
Here’s how to do it:
javascript
const { ethers } = require("ethers");
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider("https://mainnet.base.org");

const positionManagerAddress = "0x8279226865B008CdaCd9Ccd970d000B4b8C3fA58"; // Verify this!
const positionManagerABI = [
  "function balanceOf(address owner) external view returns (uint256)",
  "function tokenOfOwnerByIndex(address owner, uint256 index) external view returns (uint256)",
  "function positions(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (uint96 nonce, address operator, address token0, address token1, uint24 fee, int24 tickLower, int24 tickUpper, uint128 liquidity, uint256 feeGrowthInside0LastX128, uint256 feeGrowthInside1LastX128, uint128 tokensOwed0, uint128 tokensOwed1)"
];

const positionContract = new ethers.Contract(positionManagerAddress, positionManagerABI, provider);

async function getUserPositions(userAddress) {
  try {
    // Step 1: Get the number of NFTs owned by the wallet
    const nftCount = await positionContract.balanceOf(userAddress);
    console.log(`NFT Count: ${nftCount.toString()}`);

    if (nftCount.eq(0)) {
      console.log("No Slipstream positions found for this wallet.");
      return;
    }

    // Step 2: Fetch each tokenId and position data
    for (let i = 0; i < nftCount; i++) {
      const tokenId = await positionContract.tokenOfOwnerByIndex(userAddress, i);
      console.log(`Token ID: ${tokenId.toString()}`);

      // Step 3: Fetch position details
      const position = await positionContract.positions(tokenId);
      console.log(`Position for Token ID ${tokenId}:`, position);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching positions:", error);
  }
}

// Example usage
const userAddress = "0xYourWalletAddressHere";
getUserPositions(userAddress);

Step 4: Debug the Error
Run the code above with your wallet address. If you still get "could not decode result data," check these:
Correct Contract Address:
Verify the positionManagerAddress on basescan.org. Look for a contract with positions, balanceOf, and tokenOfOwnerByIndex functions under Aerodrome’s deployments.

If unsure, query the Aerodrome team on Discord or check their GitHub for the exact Slipstream address on Base.
Token ID Ownership:
Ensure the tokenId returned by tokenOfOwnerByIndex is valid. If the wallet transferred the NFT but still shows it in some interfaces (e.g., MetaMask), it might not own it anymore. Cross-check with ownerOf(tokenId) if available.
ethers.js Decoding:
If the ABI is correct but decoding fails, log the raw data:
javascript
const rawData = await provider.call({
  to: positionManagerAddress,
  data: positionContract.interface.encodeFunctionData("positions", [tokenId])
});
console.log("Raw Data:", rawData);

Then decode manually with positionContract.interface.decodeFunctionResult("positions", rawData) to isolate the issue.
Network Issues:
Ensure your Base RPC endpoint is reliable. Test with a different provider (e.g., Alchemy’s Base endpoint: https://base-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY).
Step 5: Interpret the Position Data
Once you successfully fetch the position, the returned tuple gives you:
token0, token1: The token pair (e.g., WETH/USDC).

tickLower, tickUpper: The price range of the position.

liquidity: The amount of liquidity provided.

tokensOwed0, tokensOwed1: Uncollected fees.
To calculate token amounts, you’d need to interact with the pool contract (found via token0, token1, and fee) and use the tick values with a library like Uniswap’s SDK, adapted for Aerodrome.
If You’re Still Stuck
Please share:
The exact code you’re using (especially the ABI and contract address).

The full error message.

The tokenId you’re querying (if known).
I can pinpoint the issue further. Alternatively, if Slipstream querying is too complex, consider starting with vAMM pools (simpler LP tokens) or using Aerodrome’s subgraph for an easier API-based solution. Let me know how to assist next!
